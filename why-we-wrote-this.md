#Why we wrote this _Code of Conduct_

In the open source world there seem to be mostly conference codes of conduct (like the infinitely popular [Pycon](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/) one) and only a small handful of contributor ones like the [contributor covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) used by [24 pull requests](http://24pullrequests.com/).    

**We found that there is _heavy focus_ in the tech industry on _preventing discrimination and harassment_.**

This is both essential and (sadly) required for now, but **we felt that these don't sum up the people we want to work with**.     
When people look at your code of conduct they _see a set of expected behaviours_ and **we don't want people to just 'not be a [jerk](http://jerk.urbanup.com/1365784#.VZzZ8ujZ8fY)', we want them to 'be awesome'**! 

So we started writing our own, evolving code. Feel free to fork it and reuse any parts of it you like for your own work!
